# NLP-Assignment-1
Assignment 1 for Statistical NLP Course

In this assignment, i have examined the fundamental laws of natural language processing such as Zipfâ€™s Law [1]. Also i have gained experience on working with language data, forming a corpus and performing basic preprocessing on this data. Also we have examined the effect of the writer and genre on the corpus and removing stopwords on the relationship between token size and the word type frequencies.
